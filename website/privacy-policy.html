								<ol>
								<li><strong> How we use your Personal Information </strong></li>
								</ol>
								<p>How we use your Personal Information depends on the Services you use and how you configure your settings. The purposes for which we use your Personal Information are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong><u>To provide the Services and personalize your experience:</u></strong> We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide user support, and operate and maintain the Services. For example, we use the name and profile picture you provide in your account to identify you to other users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your experience, and improve your ability to meet up with other users.</li>
								<li><strong><u>For research and development</u></strong><strong>: </strong>We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, more secure, integrated and useful to you. We use data about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.</li>
								<li><strong><u>To communicate with you about the Services:</u></strong> We use your contact information to send communications via email, mobile phone and within the Services, including responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing user support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. We also send you communications as you onboard to the Services to help you become more proficient in using that Services. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt-out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.</li>
								<li><strong><u>Customer support:</u></strong>We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.</li>
								<li><strong><u>For safety and security:</u></strong> We use information about you and your use of the Services to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of our End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) and other policies.</li>
								<li><strong><u>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:</u></strong> Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims and proceedings, as well as for compliance, regulatory, and audit purposes.</li>
								<li><strong><u>With your consent:</u></strong> We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so, for purposes not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured user stories to promote the Services, with your permission.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><u>III. How we share your Personal Information </u></strong></p>
								<p>We share information we collect about you in the ways stated below:</p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong><u>Sharing within our group and with third parties:</u></strong> We share information with our group companies and third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize and support our Services.</li>
								<li><strong><u>Service providers:</u></strong> We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</li>
								<li><strong><u>Links to third party sites:</u></strong> The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you access any of these third party sites or services, the processing of your information may be governed by their policies.</li>
								<li><strong><u>With your consent:</u></strong> We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied users on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name, profile picture, organization and job title, alongside the testimonial.</li>
								<li><strong><u>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights</u></strong><strong>:</strong> In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements; (b) enforce our agreements, policies and Terms of Use; (c) protect the security or integrity of our Services, or (d) protect SimpleO, our users or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.</li>
								<li><strong><u>As part of a business transaction</u></strong><strong>: </strong>If SimpleO is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Information may be transferred.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><u>International transfers</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong><u>International transfers of information we collect</u></strong><strong>: </strong>We collect information globally and primarily store that information in the United States and Europe. We transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services.</li>
								<li><strong><u>International transfers to third parties</u></strong><strong>: </strong>Some of the third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside.</li>
								</ul>
								<ol>
								<li><strong><u> How we store and secure Personal Information</u></strong></li>
								</ol>
								<ul>
								<li><strong><u>Information storage and security</u></strong><strong>: </strong>We use data hosting service providers in the United States and Europe to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. For more information on where we store your information, please contact us at hello@simpleo.ai. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</li>
								<li><strong><u>How long we keep information</u></strong><strong>: </strong>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</li>
								<li><strong><u>Account information:</u></strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</li>
								<li><strong><u>Information you share on the Services:</u></strong> If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow other users to make full use of the Services.</li>
								<li><strong><u>Marketing information:</u></strong> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your SimpleO account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created. Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</li>

								<li><strong><u>Request that we stop using your information / withdrawal of consent:</u></strong> In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user and wish to delete your account, you can request that we delete your profile or account as provided in this Privacy Policy. Where you have provided us with consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us at hello@simpleo.ai.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.
